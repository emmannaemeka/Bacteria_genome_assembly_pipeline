# Bacteria_genome_assembly_pipeline
Like you I have been struggling with how to assemble my genome. One major problem is having to run each step over and over for each sequence. So I decided to create a script that can take your sequence, create a new directory, check the quality of your reads, trim adapters and assemble using Spades.  After which you can examine your assembly and proceed with annotation. Let me know if it helps your work.  if you notice any bug, please write me.
